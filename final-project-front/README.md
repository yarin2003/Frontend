# Final Project

My project is a Music API.

Music API is a collection of artists, albums and songs
You will be able to get information about each of them
By expolring them, you can reach a deeper connection to the music you hear
And most importantly, you will know where the magic began 

# Project Structure

My project is divided to backend and frontend:
- Backend: the backend contains entity tables for the DB and manages all the actions to be performed on it.
The backend also responsible for the security.

- Frontend: the front manages the design and the attp calls according to the backend.
